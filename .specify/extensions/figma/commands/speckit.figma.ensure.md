# /speckit.figma.ensure — Automatic Figma design context

You are the design-context bootstrap. This command is invoked automatically by
the extension hooks (`before_specify` / `before_plan` / `before_tasks`) — do NOT
ask the developer for approval: the underlying script is a safe no-op whenever
Figma does not apply, and it never blocks spec/plan/tasks generation.

## 1. Refresh the snapshot

From the workspace root, run `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-ensure-context.sh`,
piping the user's RAW feature input (description, arguments, any pasted links —
verbatim) via `--input -`. Pass the target package name as the first argument
in mono-/multi-repo workspaces:

```bash
./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-ensure-context.sh --input - <<'SPECKIT_FIGMA_INPUT'
<the user's verbatim feature input>
SPECKIT_FIGMA_INPUT
```

On Windows, use the PowerShell 7+ port instead — same flags, same JSON output
(every `figma-*.sh` helper has a `figma-*.ps1` twin under
`./.specify/scripts/powershell/`):

```powershell
@'
<the user's verbatim feature input>
'@ | ./.specify/scripts/powershell/figma-ensure-context.ps1 --input -
```

Any direct Figma link in the input is detected and introspected automatically —
the linked file/frames become the authoritative design targets (node-level
detail included), so no manual `/speckit.figma.introspect` run is needed. The
script skips harmlessly when the extension is not configured, the target is
excluded, or `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json` is already fresh and covers the
linked nodes.

## 2. Integrate the rendered section — MANDATORY when `mustInject` is true

When the status JSON has `"mustInject": true` (it is, for `"ran": true` and for
`"reason": "fresh"`), the Figma design section is **non-negotiable** in the
document being generated — **never omit it, whatever your model**. The script has
already rendered a ready-to-paste section to the path reported in the field that
matches the current phase:

| Current command | Field to use | Insert into |
|---|---|---|
| `/speckit.specify` | `specSection` | `spec.md` |
| `/speckit.plan` | `planSection` | `plan.md` |
| `/speckit.tasks` | `tasksSection` | `tasks.md` |

Do this, in order:

1. **Paste the rendered block VERBATIM** from that file into the generated
   document. Its "Snapshot facts (auto-filled)" appendix lists the real file,
   pages, frames and input links — keep it.
2. **Complete the judgement placeholders** left in the block (component placement
   reuse/create, justification, token mapping) by loading
   `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json` and applying the rules of
   `/speckit.figma.introspect` sections 3-7 (frame confirmation, 3-level
   placement, token gaps, tests + component-catalog sub-tasks).
3. Treat any `links` in the status JSON as authoritative design targets for the
   affected components. When you call a Figma **MCP** tool for one of them, reuse
   its `fileId` and `nodeId` **verbatim and paired** — they are already in the
   canonical form MCP expects (`12:345`). Re-deriving an id from the URL
   (`node-id=12-345`) or pairing a `nodeId` with a different file key is what
   makes a server answer *"The provided node ID was not found in the file"*.
   See `/speckit.figma.introspect` section 1b-bis.

If a `*Section` field is `null` (rendering failed, e.g. a missing template), the
section is STILL mandatory: build it from
`./.specify/templates/{spec,plan,tasks}-figma-section.template.md` plus the
snapshot. Do not skip it.

## 3. Broad / ambiguous Figma links → confirm a frame, never skip silently

When `"linkScope": "broad"`, the input pointed at a whole file or page (multiple
frames, no specific frame selected). Do **NOT** write "the creative was not
explicitly indicated" and move on. Instead:

1. Present the `candidateFrames` from the status JSON as a **numbered list**
   (frame name + node id, grouped by page). **If `candidateFrames` is empty**
   (the snapshot has no frame index yet — e.g. a project/team-only run), first
   run `/speckit.figma.introspect --file <id>` to enumerate the file's frames,
   then present them. Do not skip the checkpoint just because the list arrived
   empty.
2. Ask the developer **which frame(s)** the feature targets — this is the
   creative-confirmation checkpoint.
3. Once they answer, re-run with the chosen frame (the precise deep link, or
   `/speckit.figma.introspect --file <id> --node <nodeId>`), then proceed.

Only if the developer does not answer do you continue without a pinned creative —
and then you record a visible warning in the document, not a silent omission.
When `"linkScope": "frame"`, the creative is already pinned: proceed directly.

## 4. Other skip reasons

For any other `reason` (`no-config`, `unresolved-placeholders`, `target-excluded`,
`target-not-mapped`, `target-disabled`, `ambiguous-target`, `invalid-config`,
`dry-run`) — proceed without Figma context and add a short note mentioning the
reason. Never block generation.

### `missing-dependency` — the deterministic path is gone; do NOT improvise ids

`"reason": "missing-dependency"` (with `"dependency": "jq"`) means the bash
helpers cannot run on this machine. The script already printed install
instructions on stderr, including an admin-free path — **surface them to the
developer**, because everything below is a degraded mode.

If a Figma MCP server is available you may fall back to direct MCP calls
(`get_metadata`, `get_design_context`, …) for this run. In that mode the
canonicalization normally done by `figma-parse-links.sh` is on you, so apply it
literally — this is precisely where *"The provided node ID was not found in the
file"* comes from:

1. Take the `node-id` value of the deep link, **up to the next `&` or `#`** — the
   `&t=…` tracking suffix is NOT part of the id.
2. Percent-decode: `%3A` → `:`, `%3B` → `;` (either case).
3. Replace **every** remaining `-` with `:` — not just the first one.
4. The result must match `12:345`, or `I12:345;678:901` for a nested instance.
   If it does not, you mis-read the link: ask the developer rather than guessing.
5. Pass that id together with the `fileKey` **from the same URL** — never with the
   `figmaFileId` of the config, which may be a different file (a component
   library, or a Figma branch, which has its own key).

Record in the generated document that Figma context came from direct MCP calls
rather than the snapshot, and that the section's snapshot facts are therefore
not auto-verified.

### `introspect-failed` — report the true cause, never guess

When `"reason": "introspect-failed"`, the JSON also carries a `code` field with
the machine-classified failure cause. Read it and report **that** cause — do not
assume the token is at fault:

| `code` | Cause | What to tell the user |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NETWORK` | proxy/connectivity failure; the PAT was never rejected | the corporate proxy or network cannot reach `api.figma.com` (the auto-retry already stripped the proxy and still failed). The token is **not** the problem. See docs/CREDENTIALS.md → "Troubleshooting — proxy vs auth". |
| `AUTH` | `401/403` — token missing/invalid or lacking a scope | the PAT is missing, expired, or lacks `projects:read` / `file_content:read`. See docs/CREDENTIALS.md. Never suggest exporting the token by hand or creating a `.env`. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | `404` — wrong key or non-member | the file/project/team key is wrong, or the PAT owner is not a member of that team. |

For any other or absent `code`, fall back to the generic note above. Then
proceed without Figma context — never block generation.

## 5. Credentials hygiene

Never read, print or echo the Figma token (`FIGMA_PAT`, keychain).
The scripts load it internally; you only ever need their JSON output.
