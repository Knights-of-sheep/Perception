#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
# install.sh — install the SpecKit Figma extension into a target workspace
# =============================================================================
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh [--target <workspace-root>] [--mode single-repo|mono-repo|multi-repo]
#                [--prompt-hooks | --no-hooks] [--no-readme]
# What it does (idempotent):
#   - copies the figma.projects.config example to <root>/figma.projects.config.json
#   - copies the helper scripts to <root>/.specify/scripts/bash/ (docs and
#     commands invoke ./.specify/scripts/bash/*.sh from the workspace root, the
#     SpecKit convention — alongside .specify/memory/)
#   - ensures the .figma/cache/ directory (generated/cached artifacts) is git-ignored
#   - installs the design-rules constitution base into .figma/ (committed, next to
#     cache/; extension-owned, always refreshed) and creates the user overlay
#     .figma/figma-design-rules.custom.md once (skip-if-exists; never overwritten,
#     so project customizations survive updates)
#   - copies the user guides (CREDENTIALS / INSTALL / MONOREPO) to .figma/docs/
#     (extension-owned, always refreshed — the workspace docs match the
#     installed version, and work offline)
#   - appends/refreshes a managed "Figma design context" section in the
#     workspace README.md (created if missing): extension version + layout mode,
#     the read-only PAT setup, and links to the local .figma/docs/ guides.
#     Same marker mechanism as the prompt auto-context block; the rest of the
#     README is never touched. --no-readme skips it entirely.
#   - by default LEAVES the /speckit.specify, /speckit.plan and /speckit.tasks
#     prompts untouched (automatic Figma context runs via the extension.yml hooks
#     before_specify/before_plan/before_tasks -> /speckit.figma.ensure) and removes any
#     auto-context block a previous version injected. --prompt-hooks opts back
#     into prompt injection for agents without SpecKit extension-hook support;
#     --no-hooks touches nothing (not even cleanup).
#   - prints the next steps (it does NOT replace placeholders or write tokens)

## Figma design context (automatic)

Before generating, refresh the Figma design context:

1. From the workspace root, run `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-ensure-context.sh`
   (or, on Windows, the PowerShell 7+ port
   `./.specify/scripts/powershell/figma-ensure-context.ps1` — same flags, same
   output), piping the user's RAW feature input (description, arguments, any
   pasted links — verbatim) via `--input -` (pass the target package name as
   the first argument in mono-/multi-repo workspaces):

   ```bash
   ./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-ensure-context.sh --input - <<'SPECKIT_FIGMA_INPUT'
   <the user's verbatim feature input>
   SPECKIT_FIGMA_INPUT
   ```

   ```powershell
   @'
   <the user's verbatim feature input>
   '@ | ./.specify/scripts/powershell/figma-ensure-context.ps1 --input -
   ```

   Any direct Figma link in the input is detected and introspected
   automatically — the linked file/frames become the authoritative design
   targets (node-level detail included), so no manual
   /speckit.figma.introspect run is needed. The script is a safe no-op when
   the extension is not configured, the target is excluded, or
   `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json` is already fresh and covers the linked
   nodes.
2. When it prints `"ran": true` or `"reason": "fresh"` with `"mustInject": true`,
   the Figma design section is MANDATORY in this document — never omit it,
   whatever the agent model. The script renders a ready-to-paste section to the
   path reported in `specSection` / `planSection` / `tasksSection` (the one
   matching this command): insert that rendered block VERBATIM into the
   generated document, then load `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json` and complete the
   judgement placeholders by applying the rules of `/speckit.figma.introspect`
   (sections 3-7: frame confirmation, component placement, token gaps, tests +
   Storybook sub-tasks). Treat any `links` reported in the status JSON as
   authoritative design targets for the affected components.
3. For any other skip reason, proceed without Figma context and add a short
   note mentioning the reason.

Next steps:
  1. Edit figma.projects.config.json — list targets, fill excluded[], replace REPLACE_WITH_* ids.
  2. Local dev: store your READ-ONLY Figma PAT in the OS credential store and export
     FIGMA_PAT_COMMAND in your shell profile (full guide: .figma/docs/CREDENTIALS.md,
     also linked from the figma section of your README).
     macOS (keychain), e.g. in ~/.zshrc:
       security add-generic-password -s figma-pat -a "\$USER" -w 'figd_xxxxxxxx'
       echo 'export FIGMA_PAT_COMMAND="security find-generic-password -s figma-pat -w"' >> ~/.zshrc
     Windows (PowerShell 7+ SecretManagement), in your PowerShell profile:
       Set-Secret -Name figma-pat -Secret 'figd_xxxxxxxx'
       \$env:FIGMA_PAT_COMMAND = 'Get-Secret figma-pat -AsPlainText'
     CI / Cloud Agent: set credentials.source = "ci-secret" and inject a platform secret.
  3. Validate (from the workspace root):
       macOS/Linux:  ./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-validate-config.sh
       Windows:      pwsh -File ./.specify/scripts/powershell/figma-validate-config.ps1
  4. Register the extension commands (commands/speckit.figma.*.md)
     with your SpecKit agent of choice — or install natively with
     'specify extension add' (see extension.yml / docs/INSTALL.md), which registers
     /speckit.figma.setup, /speckit.figma.update, /speckit.figma.ensure,
     /speckit.figma.introspect and /speckit.figma.verify for you.
