# /speckit.figma.introspect — Autonomous Figma introspection

You are the design-context agent. Operate autonomously across the mapped pages,
but respect the explicit human-confirmation checkpoints below. Always load and
obey `./.figma/figma-design-rules.md` (same path in a consumer workspace and in
the extension checkout), then load the optional user overlay
`./.figma/figma-design-rules.custom.md` if it exists. The overlay MAY add, refine
or override any base rule; **on conflict, the overlay wins**.

> **Automatic invocation:** the extension hooks (`before_specify` /
> `before_tasks`) invoke `/speckit.figma.ensure`, which runs
> `figma-ensure-context.sh` with the feature input piped in via `--input -`,
> so a fresh snapshot is usually already present — **including node-level
> detail for any direct Figma links pasted in the feature input**, which the
> hook parses and introspects on its own. (Agents without extension-hook
> support can opt into prompt injection with `install.sh --prompt-hooks`.)
> Run this command manually for deep dives (specific nodes, custom depth,
> team/project exploration) or to force a refresh.

## Scripts

Run these from the workspace root. The short names used below map to:

- `detect` → `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-detect-target.sh`
- `parse` → `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-parse-links.sh`
- `resolve` → `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-resolve-source.sh`
- `introspect` → `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-introspect.sh`
- `ensure` → `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-ensure-context.sh` (auto pre-specify/tasks
  hook: introspects only when the snapshot is missing or stale; safe no-op
  otherwise)

On Windows, use the PowerShell 7+ ports instead — same flags, same JSON output:
replace `./.specify/scripts/bash/<name>.sh` with
`./.specify/scripts/powershell/<name>.ps1` (run from `pwsh`).

## 0. Inputs & direct Figma links

- First, scan the user-provided input for direct Figma links. Run the `parse`
  script over the input. For every detected `{fileId, nodeId}`, treat it as an
  **authoritative design target**: use it directly (via `introspect --file <id>
  --node <nodeId>`) instead of, or in addition to, the page mapping. Direct links
  always take precedence over config mapping for the components they reference.
- **Broad link (file/page, no specific frame).** When a link has **no `nodeId`**,
  or its `nodeId` is a page/canvas rather than a top-level FRAME, the target
  creative is NOT pinned down. Do **not** record "the creative was not explicitly
  indicated" and stop. Instead introspect the file, **enumerate its top-level
  frames as a numbered list** (frame name + node id, grouped by page) and **ask
  the developer which frame(s)** the feature targets — this is the
  creative-confirmation checkpoint (section 3). Proceed once they pick one, then
  drill into that node. Only continue without a pinned creative if they do not
  answer, and then surface a visible warning rather than a silent skip. (The
  `ensure` hook reports this as `"linkScope": "broad"` with a `candidateFrames`
  list ready to present.)

## 1. Gate

- Resolve the feature's target package, then run `detect`. If `enabled` is
  `false` (excluded / not-mapped / disabled), **skip Figma entirely** and note it.
- If a `figmaFileId` is a `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholder, stop with a blocking error.

## 1b. Select the design-context engine (REST default, optional MCP)

- Run the `resolve` script. It returns the **effective** engine for this run:
  - `effective: "rest"` — use the portable REST engine: drive `introspect` (curl +
    jq) and reason over the resulting `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json`. This is the
    default and the only engine guaranteed in CI.
  - `effective: "mcp"` — a Figma **MCP server** is configured and reachable. Prefer
    its richer tools (e.g. code/variables/screenshot retrieval) for design context,
    using the `mcp.url` / `serverName` from the config. Still run `introspect` to
    refresh the local snapshot as a portable baseline.
- **Fallback is automatic:** when `contextSource: "mcp"` but the MCP server is
  unreachable, `resolve` reports `fellBack: true` and `effective: "rest"`. Proceed
  with REST and surface a short, non-blocking note. Only treat an unreachable MCP
  server as a hard error when `mcp.fallbackToRest` is `false` (the script exits
  non-zero and `effective` is `null`).
- Never assume MCP is present: portability (REST) is the contract; MCP is an
  opt-in enrichment for those who run the server.

### 1b-bis. Node-id contract for MCP tools — never hand-extract an id

Figma writes node ids one way in URLs (`node-id=12-345`) and expects another in
its API and in every MCP server (`12:345`). Re-deriving that mapping yourself is
the single most common cause of *"The provided node ID was not found in the
file"* — the server is telling you the id it received does not exist, not that
the frame was deleted. So:

- **Take ids from the `parse` script, never from the raw URL.** Its `nodeId`
  field is already canonical (`12:345`, or `I12:345;678:901` for a nested
  instance). The `ensure` hook exposes the same values under `links`.
- **Pass `fileId` and `nodeId` from the SAME parse result** to any MCP tool.
  Mixing the `figmaFileId` of the config with a `nodeId` coming from a different
  link (a component library, a Figma **branch** — a branch has its own file key)
  produces the exact same error.
- **Never truncate or reconstruct.** `node-id=12-345&t=Xy9Z-4` yields `12:345`;
  the `&t=…` tracking suffix is not part of the id.
- When `parse` returns `nodeId: null`, the link is **broad** — do not invent an
  id: run the creative-confirmation checkpoint (section 3).
- The REST path is already immune: `introspect --node` canonicalizes its input
  and refuses a malformed id up front, so use `introspect --file <id> --node
  <nodeId>` as the cross-check whenever an MCP call reports a missing node. If
  REST returns the node and MCP does not, the id is right and the **server** is
  the problem — see the next point.
- **When the scripts cannot run at all** (`jq` missing → `ensure` answers
  `"reason": "missing-dependency"`), you own the canonicalization. Apply it
  literally, step by step: cut the `node-id` value at the next `&` or `#`;
  decode `%3A` → `:` and `%3B` → `;`; replace **every** remaining `-` with `:`;
  check the result against `12:345` / `I12:345;678:901`; pair it with the
  `fileKey` from the *same* URL. Do not skip step 3 after the first separator,
  and do not reconstruct an id from memory. Also relay the install instructions
  the script printed — the degraded mode should not become permanent.
- **Local Dev Mode server (`http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`)** only sees the file
  currently open in the Figma desktop app. Any node of any other file is
  legitimately "not found". Tell the developer to open the right file in Figma
  Desktop, or to switch to the hosted server (`https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`), which
  is file-agnostic. `resolve` reports the configured URL in `mcp.url`.

## 1c. When introspection fails — report the true cause, never guess

If `introspect` exits non-zero, it has already classified the failure and printed
a cause-specific diagnostic to **stderr**. Read it and report that cause — do not
default to "authentication required":

- `NETWORK/PROXY error` (curl exit 5, or exit 6 / HTTP `000` with a proxy set) —
  a corporate proxy or the network cannot reach `api.figma.com`. The single curl
  chokepoint already retried once with every proxy variable stripped; if it still
  failed, the **proxy/network is at fault, not the token**. See .specify/extensions/figma/docs/CREDENTIALS.md
  → "Troubleshooting — proxy vs auth".
- `AUTH/SCOPE error` (`401/403`) — the PAT is missing, expired, or lacks
  `projects:read` / `file_content:read`. See .specify/extensions/figma/docs/CREDENTIALS.md. Never suggest
  exporting the token by hand or creating a `.env`.
- `404` — the file/project/team key is wrong, or the PAT owner is not a member of
  that team.

## 2. Autonomous traversal

- Resolve the design source for the target from the strongest signal available
  (an explicit direct link always wins), then walk the Figma hierarchy
  **organization > team > project > file > page > frame** without per-step human
  approval:
  - `figmaTeamId` / `figmaTeamIds` set → run `introspect --team <teamId>` (repeat
    `--team` for each id). The script enumerates **every project of each team**,
    then **every file of each project**, writing a nested `teams[] → projects[] →
    files[]` index into `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json`. Use it to autonomously
    pick the relevant files, then drill into their pages.
  - `figmaProjectId` set → run `introspect --project <projectId>` to enumerate all
    files of that single project.
  - `figmaFileId` set → run `introspect --file <fileId>` to introspect one file.
  - The agent MUST be able to walk the whole team/project/file tree from a single
    team or project id; it never asks the developer to approve each page.
- When a team or project enumeration surfaces several files, select the file(s)
  relevant to the feature (e.g. by name and by `pageToPackageMapping`), then
  re-run `introspect --file <id>` on each to extract its pages.
- Restrict extraction to pages declared in `pageToPackageMapping`. Ignore
  unmapped pages.
- Extract design detail to the depth the feature needs. At the default
  `--depth 2` the snapshot indexes pages, top-level frames and the file's
  component/style metadata (`components`, `componentSets`, `styles`). For
  nested layers, component instances, variant properties and layout constraints
  (auto-layout direction, padding, gap), re-run `introspect --file <id>
  --depth <N>` with a deeper tree and/or `introspect --file <id> --node
  <nodeId>` for each frame of interest — the raw node JSON (fills, typography,
  spacing, radius, shadows) lands in the snapshot's `nodes` field. Reuse the
  cached `.figma/cache/context-snapshot.json` within the session; rely on the
  script's backoff for HTTP 429.

## 3. Creative identification checkpoint

- For each component, identify the candidate frames you believe correspond to it,
  across whatever breakpoints the design provides. Before producing tasks from them,
  send the developer the Figma deep links and ask them to confirm you targeted the
  right creative. Proceed once confirmed; if the developer corrects you, re-introspect
  the corrected node.
- **Responsive policy is project-specific** (design-rules base rule 4). Implement the
  breakpoints the design provides; do not invent a layout for a breakpoint the mockups
  do not show. Follow any responsive policy declared in the overlay
  (`.figma/figma-design-rules.custom.md`) or the project constitution — e.g. a
  mobile-first policy may require interpolating an absent tablet breakpoint. Whenever
  you interpolate, state it explicitly. Absent a declared policy, cover exactly the
  breakpoints the mockups define and flag any gap instead of guessing.

## 4. Component placement (3-level resolution)

First determine whether the project **has a Design System**: a package/path with
`role: "design-system"` (mono/multi-repo) or a `designSystem` entry (single-repo) in
`figma.projects.config.json`. **No DS configured?** Skip level 2 below — the
resolution collapses to *reuse (from a shared lib) → create in app/lib*; never
invent a Design System.

For every component, decide placement and record an explicit justification:

1. **Reuse** — query the Design System inventory (`designSystem`) when configured,
   else any shared lib. If an equivalent exists, generate a *reuse* task. Never
   duplicate it.
2. **Create in Design System** — only when a DS is configured AND the component is
   **purely presentational (no business logic, no data fetching, no routing, no
   domain state)** AND is reused (or clearly intended for reuse) beyond a single
   feature or app. If business logic is present, it MUST NOT go to the DS. With no DS
   configured, skip this level.
3. **Create in app / shared lib** — feature/app-specific → app package; shared logic
   → domain lib. This is the default target when there is no Design System.

- **Shared mockups:** when a page is `shared: true` / `sharedAcross` lists several
  apps (e.g. a header, a navigation bar, or an authentication dialog reused by
  several apps or features), route the component once to the shared location (DS if
  pure UI, else shared lib) and reference it from each consumer — never duplicate.
- **Doubt about the level:** if you are unsure where a component belongs, **ask the
  developer**, explaining precisely what is causing the doubt (e.g. "this card
  contains a price-formatting rule, which looks like business logic → DS is not
  allowed; should it go to lib-cart-domain or stay app-local?"). This is the
  `ambiguous` → `ask` path. If the developer skips, continue without Figma context
  for that component and surface a visible warning in the spec and the task.

## 5. Token-gap detection

- **No Design System / token source configured?** There are no token gaps to detect:
  map values to whatever `tokenSource` the project declares (theme file, CSS
  variables, …), or emit raw values as the norm. Do NOT open a "Design System Token
  Gaps" section — a gap only exists relative to an existing DS/token source.
- When mapping extracted Figma values to Design System tokens, if a value has no
  matching DS token (a **token gap**), do not silently invent one:
  - Record the gap in the spec under a **"Design System Token Gaps"** section
    (Figma value, nearest DS token if any, affected component).
  - Ask whether the Design System should be updated. The agent NEVER mutates the
    Design System directly; the DS update follows the project's own process (e.g. a
    CI pipeline, or review by the DS owner), as declared in the overlay
    (`.figma/figma-design-rules.custom.md`) or the project constitution.
  - Until resolved, output the raw value flagged as a tokenization candidate.

## 6. UI component changes → tests (and component docs)

- Whenever a task creates or modifies a UI component, it MUST also add or update
  automated tests (unit/interaction) for that component. Emit these as explicit
  sub-tasks; a UI change without tests is incomplete.
- When the project maintains a component catalog/workbench (e.g. Storybook), also
  emit a sub-task to create or update the corresponding entry. Follow any overlay
  rule that makes a specific catalog mandatory.

## 7. Output — render the section deterministically, then complete it

The design section is **mandatory** in spec/plan/tasks whenever Figma applies,
regardless of the agent model. Do not hand-assemble it from scratch:

1. Run the renderer for the phase you are generating, e.g.
   `./.specify/scripts/bash/figma-render-section.sh --phase spec` (or `plan` /
   `tasks`; on Windows `./.specify/scripts/powershell/figma-render-section.ps1`).
   It fills every deterministic placeholder from the snapshot (file,
   pages, top-level frames, components/styles, context engine, input links) and
   writes `.figma/cache/section.<phase>.md`. The `ensure` hook already does this and
   reports the path in `specSection` / `planSection` / `tasksSection`.
2. **Paste that rendered block verbatim** into the generated document.
3. **Complete the judgement fields** it leaves open (per-component placement +
   justification, frame links across the provided breakpoints, responsive note per
   the project's policy, token mappings, token gaps, tests and component-catalog
   sub-tasks) using the rules above.

The templates live at `./.specify/templates/{spec,plan,tasks}-figma-section.template.md`
(installed by `install.sh` / `install.ps1`) — used by the renderer and as a manual
fallback if it fails. Never omit the section when a Figma creation applies.
